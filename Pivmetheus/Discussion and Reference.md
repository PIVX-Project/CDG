## 6.1. Options for Optimization

**These Options Are Not Necessary, but May be Advantageous.**

They have the disadvantage of making it more difficult for people to understand the voting math.

* account snapshotting combined with exponential-curve and power law analysis and timing allows emphasizing accounts that are relatively certain to not be misrepresenting themselves

* Use of zero knowledge proofs in order to allow ZPIVs to influence voting.

* allowing exchanges to vote in the network effect layer

* creation of defense and defense intelligence functions to play a role in network support and intelligence layers. Such defense function may be responsible for legal and memetics concerns (Public Relations).

* use of automatic network tuning mathematics to auto-tune the voting/feedback system.

* use of private identity systems to bolster voting information

* Use of transaction fee information to bolster voting information

* use of iterative voting

* use of vote history to adjust vote weights


## 6.2 Example Instruments for System Guidance Panel

Some of these measures have already been implemented.
See:  http://www.presstab.pw/phpexplorer/PIVX/index.php,  http://pivx.masternodes.pro/

* least squares approximation of negative exponential curve distribution for account values below 10k pivs
* least squares approximation of power law curve distribution for account values above 10k pivs
* Pivs in Masternodes vs Pivs Staked
* Number of Masternodes
* Number of Staking nodes
* Transaction volume/day
* Layer vs layer vote percentages
* Vote blocking events where a single layer blocks below the blocking threshold
* Number of Vote Nodes
* Average PIVS represented by vote nodes
* Average number of accounts represented by vote nodes
* BTC and USD prices
* rms price volatility measure
* BTC/USD price derivatives
* Estimated price shift time constant (amount of time required to make 63% of a price correction)
* Estimated current value (based primarily off of a single pole fir filter with above time constant)
* Estimated pump pool size
* Estimated dump pool size
